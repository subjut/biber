Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex, with full Unicode
support.

  * Please note - the default download for all platforms is 64-bit. Please
    look in the files section for the correct 32-bit platform instead of
    using the default download button if you want 32-bit.

REQUIREMENTS

  Biber is written in Perl with the aim of providing a
  customised and sophisticated data preparation backend for biblatex.

  You do not need to install Perl use biber--binaries
  are provided for many operating systems via the main TeX
  distributions (TeXLive, MacTeX, MiKTeX) and also via download from SourceForge.

  You only need a Perl installation to use biber in one of the following
  cases:

  * A binary version is not available for your OS/platform
  * You wish to keep up with all of the bleeding-edge git commits before
    they are packaged into a binary.

  For the vast majority of users, using the latest binary for the
  OS/platform you are using will be what you want to do. For details on the
  requirements for installing the Perl program version, please see the
  biber PDF documentation.

  The git repository for Biber is kept on github:

  https://github.com/plk/biber

  After installing, biber --help will give you the basic documentation.
