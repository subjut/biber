         addition to .dcf settings
       * Made the relevant places depend on max/min{alpha,bib}names instead of
         just max/minnames
       * Bug fixes to bblsafechars
       * Implemented user-customisable labelalpha (not yet in biblatex)
       * Implemented per-name hashes
0.9.3  (05-06-2011)
       * New mininit and minfull uniquename options
       * New minyear uniquelist option
       * Major revamp of uniqueness code
       * Moved to new external process calling module because IPC::Run
         doesn't work on Windows in packed binaries (kpsewhich was
         returning nothing).
0.9.2  (09-05-2011)
       * Some internal changes for perl 5.14
       * Bug fixes for uniquelist processing
0.9.1  (29-04-2011)
       * Made temp files all use a global temp dir.
       * Moved temp .utf8 conversions to temp dir so biber works using
         .bib files which are in non-writable locations.
       * Added back an info log message about finding data sources (Lyx compat)
0.9    (29-03-2011)

         is fraught with danger and is a mess. Best not to do it at all.
       * Supports biblatex \bibnamedelimi macro
       * Implementation of uniquename and uniquelist options for biblatex 1.4+
0.8.4  (19-03-2011)

0.8.3  14-03-2011
       * Biber now in TexLive
       * Added several new binary builds
       * All name part and element formatting is now abstracted into macros
         so that it can be controlled via biblatex.
       * Much more documentation on binary builds for packagers
       * Bug fixes
0.8.2  (14-02-2011)

       * Forces biblatex format for month field
       * Added support for remote data sources
       * Added experimental support for RIS data sources
       * Took out -a and -d flags. These are no longer very useful as the increasingly
         sophisticated biblatex options cannot be set on the command line
         anyway and so these flags are less and less relevant
       * New inheritance model in sync with biblatex defaults
       * Bug fixes
0.7.4  (05-02-2011)
       * Fix for mincrossrefs leaking across sections (biblatex SF bug #3173032)

       * Completely re-written sorting routine using Schwartzian transform
         for real multi-field support and per-field sorting settings.
       * Bug fixes

       * More comprehensive structural checks on allowed entrytypes/fields
         and field combinations/formats
       * Added option validate_structure to turn on structural checks
       * Renamed option validate -> validate_control
       * Renamed option output-directory -> output_directory
       * Added labelname and labelyear as possible sort specifications
       * Misc bug fixes
0.6    (20-11-2010)
       * First non-beta release
       * More abstracted and extensible crossref inheritance model
       * U::C dependency to 0.67
       * sortcase and sortupper options now take same argument forms as in biblatex

0.5.6  (04-10-2010)
       * Latex character macro decoding is now better defined in the whole
         (re)encoding workflow.
       * "inputenc" option is now "bblencoding"
       * "locale" option is now "sortlocale"
       * New option "sortupper"
       * Unicode::Collate sorting is now default as version 0.61 of this
         has XS module and CLDR tailoring.
       * Added binary dist build scripts
       * Removed bundled Module::Build as there are some conflicts with
         later versions. This is less of a problem anyway because the
         binary build makes it less necessary to make builds easy on perl<5.10
       * Misc bug fixes
0.5.5  (29-08-2010)
       * Biber::BibTeX moved to Biber::Input::BibTeX. If upgrading, please remove
         your installed <perl lib>/Biber/BibTeX.pm, just to be tidy
       * New aliases for EPRINT classes and types implemented (see BibLaTeX docs).
       * Biber now resolves XREFs as well as CROSSREFs so one less LaTeX pass is needed
       * Allows UTF-8 citekeys. Requires Text::BibTeX >= 0.46 and a fully UTF-8
         aware TeX macro package (e.g. XeTeX or LuaLaTeX). Normal LaTeX with \inputenc
         will not work because the UTF-8 it uses is incomplete, macro based and not native.
       * RecDescent parser is no longer supported or included. If upgrading, please remove
         your installed <perl lib>/Biber/BibTeX directory, just to be tidy
       * Now requires LaTeX::Decode >= 0.03
       * Stricter version dependency for Text::BibTeX. Older than 0.42 is
         rather useless for complex names.
       * Re-factored and enhanced auto-re-encoding of .bib/.bbl. With biblatex
         0.9c, Biber handles all reencoding.
       * Misc bug fixes
0.5.4  (04-08-2010)
       * Case-sensitive sorting option
       * Multi-section support. Only one biber pass needed to process all
         bib sections using extended biblatex 0.9b .bbl format.
       * .aux file is no longer used by biber - all information is passed
         in .bcf file.
       * Misc bug fixes
       * LaTeX::Decode is now a separate CPAN module and is no longer included
0.5.3  (19-03-2010)
       * Changed semantics of --outfile and --output-directory. --outfile
         is now relative to --output-directory. If --outfile is absolute, it
         is stripped to the filename and the path discarded. Absolute .aux
         paths are stripped to filename for appending to --output-directory.
       * Updated PRD to use new encoding option names. Now works with -e.
       * sortlos was not settable to use bib sort order
       * With Text::BibTeX >= 0.42, will do all name/initials generation with btparse
         library.
       * Abstracted BBL output into Biber::Output class for better re-use and potential
         for output formats other than .bbl.
       * Synced uniquename .bcf values with change in biblatex 0.9a
0.5.2  (04-03-2010)
       * Locale fixes
       * Uniquename fixed to match BibLaTeX option values
       * Improved error message for malformed names
       * Fixed config file problems under windows and also added option to ignore config file
       * Bug with conflicting case between citations and bib entries
       * Moved pure perl parsename to PRD.pm
       * Re-write of name parsing to use Text::BibTeX::Name by default
       * Fields which can be null are explicitly flagged
       * Add THANKS file
       * Die early when biber is called without argument
       * Fixed Mac config path error
       * .bib parse continues after certain errors
       * regularised collate options processing
       * field nameaddon was missing from Biber::Constants
       * Improved warning message for missing backend=biber
       * SF bug 2952347 fix (empty date range end)
       * uniquename counter was being provided incorrectly
0.5.1  (15-02-2010)
       * Remove support for legacy control files (\jobname-blx.bib):
         Biber now only reads .bcf files written by biblatex with the 
         option "backend=biber".
       * Improved handling of "uniquename" and "namehash".
       * Don't apply latexescape in bbl output, as it breaks math formatting.
0.5    (13-02-2010)
       * Supports all changes introduced by biblatex 0.9
       * Moved all parts relating to the experimental BibLaTeXML format to the
         "biblatexml" branch on the git repo
       * Communication between biblatex and Biber can be done through a
         XML-based config file (extension .bcf): this is enabled with the
         experimental biblatex option "backend=biber"
       * Biber can now be customized with a configuration file
       * Considerable refactoring and cleanup of the code
       * Further enhancements to the test suite
       * Improved logging mechanism
       * More robust parsing of personal names
       * Ignore certain prefixes and diacritics in sort strings, for
         instance ʿAlī is sorted under A, and al-Hasan under H. This can
         be customized in the configuration file (biber.conf).
       * New command-line option --output-directory (like TeX)
       * Many, many bugfixes

0.4.3  (23-07-2009)
       * With biblatex option "backend=biber" and biber option --v2
         the new experimental control file \jobname.bcf is used,
         which brings in many new features, such as per-entrytype
         settings.
       * More sophisticated/customizable sorting mechanism
       * More extensive test suite
       * Improved BibLaTeXML schema
       * improved handling of BibLaTeXML (enable nested children,
         formatting elements, nosort elements)
       * Do not apply latexescape() by default on xml strings
       * Skip title handling in BibLaTeXML when not existing
       * Ignore maxline, add option wraplines

       * Don't output date and urldate in the bbl
       * Add missing fields "date" "urldate" "organization" "annotator"
         "foreword" and "eventtitle"
       * Use Data::Dump instead of Data::Dumper for debugging
       * Fields "library" and "remarks" are now skipped
       * Bugfix for aliases (e.g. address, school)
       * Bugfix: process urldate to get urlyear,urlmonth,urlday
       * Remove illegal value shorttranslator from labelname option
       * Changed biberdebug option to debug
       * Changed option inputencoding to bibencoding

       * Cite keys of bib files are now case-insensitive
       * Default Unicode collation now uses the table "latinkeys.txt"
         (this is much faster than "allkeys.txt" which contains rules for
         all Unicode glyphs)
       * Unicode::Collate parameters can be passed as a command-line option
       * Faster sorting (with option -f) is also possible for specific
         locales given with option --locale (this is OS-dependent however)
       * PRD grammar is now precompiled
       * bbl output is now wrapped acc to maxline option
